# ðŸ‘— Fashion Recommender Web App

A web app for personalized fashion recommendations using **your uploaded photo**, **age**, **gender**, and **fashion prompt** (style/occasion preferences).  
It combines **machine learning** (Random Forest for body shape classification from images) and **rule-based + prompt-driven logic** for recommending outfits.

---

## Features

- **Upload Photo:** The app extracts your body measurements from a single photo (no manual entry required).
- **Specify Age & Gender:** For personalized suggestions.
- **Style Prompts:** Describe your preferred style or occasion (e.g., "business casual", "date night", "summer", etc.).
- **ML-powered Body Shape Classification:** Random Forest model determines your body shape from the image.
- **Personalized Outfit Recommendations:** Each outfit includes detailed attributes.

## System Flow

1. **User** uploads a photo and enters age, gender, and prompt.
2. **CombineSegmentationLandmarks.jsx** processes the photo (in-browser) to extract measurements.
3. Measurements, gender, and age are sent to the **body-classification API** to predict body type.
4. The predicted body type, gender, and prompt are sent to the **fashion recommendation API**.
5. **fashion-api** returns a list of recommended outfits, which are displayed to the user.

## FAQ

**Where is machine learning used?**  
For body shape prediction (Random Forest, based on measurements extracted from the image). Outfit recommendation is rule + prompt-based.

**How does prompt work?**  
Prompts are parsed for style, occasion, or other keywords and used to filter and score outfit matches.

**Can I use my own data/model?**  
Yes! You can swap out the model endpoints if you have your own.

**How do I deploy?**  
Deploy as a standard React app. APIs must be reachable from the frontend.
